What does it do?
Octocan flash retrieves/stores all of the information needed to flashe klipper to your can-bus boards, which of course it also does.

Who is this program for? 
Anyone who is running an octopus board in can bridge-mode with a Mellow SB2040 can bus board (though it can probably be used with other toolhead boards, provided they are being used on an octopus in can-bridge mode but try it out at your own risk.)

To use this program: 
  1) Download OCF.sh onto your pi.
  2) Make the file executable (chmod +x OCF.sh)
  3) Run file (./OCF.sh)

On the first run octocanflash, it will run through an install procedure and gather required information Like your UUID's.
This information is stored in the CanConfigsFolder.

Once set up the program will only require a couple pieces of input:
  1) acceptance of risk
  2) 'Enter' to flash the octopus board
  3) 'Enter' to flash the SB2040

There is a troubleshooting guide you can access at the end of the script if something went wrong and your stuff is no longer working. If you come across an error I have not addressed please submit it here and I will add it to the guide. Right now there are only two error's 

I hope some of you find this helpful, even though it is obviously overkill.
